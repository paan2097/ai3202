For Assignment 2:

commands include:

python Assignment2.py World1.txt manhattan
python Assignment2.py World2.txt manhattan
python Assignment2.py World1.txt euclidian
python Assignment2.py World2.txt euclidian

I received the same distance and path for each heuristic, and used euclidean from pythagoream theorem.

For Assignment 5:

commands include:

python Assignment5.py World1MDP.txt <E>

I could not find a value of E that would change the solution path of my program. I tried a wide range of values
for E but none of them changed by path. The only part of my program that E affected was utility values.
